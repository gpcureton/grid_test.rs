# grid_test.rs
This is a small(-ish) Rust project, for the purposes of testing out a range of common coding tasks associated with making a cli binary app which takes one or more files as input.

A todo-list if tasks which will be tried out in this repo include: 
- [x] Reading/Writing CSV files (https://crates.io/crates/csv, https://crates.io/crates/serde)
- [x] Manipulation of HashMaps (like python dictionaries)
- [x] Manipulation of general data arrays (like python lists/tuples)
- [ ] Manipulation of numeric arrays (like numpy arrays) (https://crates.io/crates/ndarray, https://crates.io/crates/nalgebra)
- [ ] Implementation of cli arg parsing using `clap` (https://crates.io/crates/clap)
- [x] Project organization / modules
- [ ] Logging
- [x] Testing
- [ ] Error reporting
- [ ] OO-like programming
- [ ] Reading/writing of HDF5 files (https://crates.io/crates/hdf5)
- [ ] Reading/writing of NetCDF4 files (https://crates.io/crates/netcdf)
- [ ] General scientific computing tasks (https://crates.io/crates/peroxide)

There is a lot of ground to cover, so at some point I will probably organize this repo into a series of workspaces which each touch on a specific task.
